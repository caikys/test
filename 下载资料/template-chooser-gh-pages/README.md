# HELLO FRIENDS.

This project is no longer being updated for the following reasons:
- The sorting options need an overhaul to be more relevant to the way JS templates are currently used (e.g., parsing speed matters very little in a real-world app where templates should be compiled on the server)
- A standard of popularity, longevity, or both needs to be applied to sort viable options from things someone built for themself and made open source as an afterthought
- __Many of the most currently popular template engines come bundled with a larger framework and cannot be examined on their own__

I don't recommend you use this to decide which stand-alone templating solution will meet your needs, because in most cases it's likely your needs would be better met by a framework wrapping templating with additional functionality.
